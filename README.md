## Synopsis

A Random Quote Machine built with React. Can be found [here](https://solaomi.github.io/random-quote-machine/).

## Motivation

Part of my current [100 Days of Code Challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/), and to get more practice with
React.

P.S. The quotes aren't really the best, but the API was easy (and free) to integrate into the project.
